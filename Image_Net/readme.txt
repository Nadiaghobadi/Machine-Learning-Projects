the P5 folder contains these files for question5:
imagenet_finetune.py: I ran this file on GPU and saved the model. (I could not attach the model to my submission because it is 101 MB)
test.py: I used the saved model in this file, I loaded the model and got the output for the first 100 test images as an example and saved the results in a html file (prediction.html). I have attached the first page of prediction.html in my report.
If you want to test the model on more data, you can change the number in line 56.
You can get the final result with the saved model by running test.py
